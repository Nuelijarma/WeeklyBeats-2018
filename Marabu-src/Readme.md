# Marabu

Marabu is a music tracker developped by Aliceffekt/Neauoire/Devine Lu Linvega/?

Marabu if the first... software? I managed to use to produce music. I think I like having the whole complexity in a single view.

# Orca

Orca is a 2D visual programing playground developped by Aliceffekt/Neauoire/Devine Lu Linvega/?.

It can serve as a tracker, as it can output midi information. This live (programming) aspect is something I want to explore. My main issue is that I have to learn to use a synth at the same time.
