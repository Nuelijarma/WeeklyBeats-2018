# WeeklyBeats-2018

## Introduction

Hi!

This is my first year doing WeeklyBeats. In fact, it is my first time publishing music online! I am trying to give some bonus material for my tracks, if someone is interested.

## Repository structure

The [Marabu-src](Marabu-src) folder contains the source of the tracks I composed with the Marabu music tracker.

If I ever try to compose differently, I will try to give some kind of source as well.
